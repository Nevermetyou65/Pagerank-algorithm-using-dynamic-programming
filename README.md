# Pagerank-algorithm-using-dynamic-programming
Recently, I've just finished a very good course in Coursera ->> "Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra".<br>
In the last week of the module, there is an assignment about "How pagerank algorithm works" in linear algebra's perspective and it is really mind-blowing.<br>

# The Pagerank algorithm..<br>
invented by the founder of **Google**, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. As the name suggested, this algorithm ranks what you are searching and return it to you in order from most important
web to the least important. And surprisingly :open_mouth: the way this algorithm work relies on a lot of math topic such as Markov Chain, Linear Algebra, Graph thory etc.

# :sparkles: Because of the recursive nature of this algorithm...
I thought to myself that this would be a good time for me to practice coding dynamic programming (and a little bit of recursive function).
SO, in this notebook, I will re-write the Pagerank algorithm in my last assignment in dynamic proramming style both bottom-up and top-down approach.

## Packages :package:
The code is entirely written in Python 3.8.8 and the main packages I utilized are:
- numpy 1.20.1
